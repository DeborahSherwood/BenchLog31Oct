You head towards the locker room to get changed over but are stopped short when you hear the door open.
A very large and dark shape fills the hallway. It reminds you of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come from A Christmas Carol. You gasp.<br />

Shrieking, you turn to run to the safety of the control room.
As you round the corner, you hear cackling behind you. Turning, you find your coworker, Scott. He has lifted the shroud to reveal his face.<br />
<span class="voiceA">"Jesus, Scott! You scared the hell out of me."</span> Your heart is still racing. He continues to to cackle.<br />
<span class="voiceB">"I'm working the Haunted Hog Farm tonight and didn't have time to go home to change."</span> He explains, still laughing.<br />
<span class="voiceA">"You could have given me a heads up." </span>You sputter, shaking your head.<br />
He lowers his shroud then jumps at you yelling <span class="voiceB">"Boo!"</span><br />
You crash backwards into a wall.

With your bare fists, you start swinging at the imposing figure.
<span class="voiceB">"Ow!"</span> you hear and take a step back, your fists still at the ready.
The Reaper lifts his shroud. Underneath, you find the familiar face of your coworker, Scott. 
He looks slightly peeved that you hit him. <br />
<br />
<span class="voiceB">"What the heck did you do that for?"</span> he asks in bewilderment.<br />
<span class="voiceA">"Are you kidding? Look at you! What are you still doing here?"</span> You drop your fists.<br />
<span class="voiceB">"I'm working the Haunted Hog Farm tonight and didn't have time to go home to change."</span> He explains in a matter of fact voice.<br />
<span class="voiceA">"You could have given me a heads up." </span>You sigh.<br />
He starts to giggle which then escalates up to a loud cackle.
<span class="voiceB">"I guess my costume is believable then."</span> He pats you on the shoulder and turns to leave, still laughing.

You chuck the heavy phone towards the creature, making contact.<br />
<span class="voiceB">"Ow!"</span> you hear a muffled sound from under the shroud.
A moment later, the creature lifts the hood to reveal your co-worker, Scott.
He looks slightly peeved that you hit him. <br />
<br />
<span class="voiceB">"What the heck did you do that for?" </span> he asks.<br />
<span class="voiceA">"Are you kidding? Look at you! What are you still doing here?" </span>You voice is higher than usual.<br />
<br />
<span class="voiceB">"I'm working the Haunted Hog Farm tonight and didn't have time to go home to change." </span>He bends down and picks up the phone.<br />
<span class="voiceB">"I think the phone survived." </span>He says, rubbing his forehead. He hands you the phone.
<span class="voiceB">"Anyway, I've got to run. You have a good night." </span>He heads towards the stairs, turning sideways to pass by you.
You feel bad you threw the phone at him and he feels bad he scared you.
