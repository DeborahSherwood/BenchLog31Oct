:: Duty Phone

The duty phone must be carried by any operator who leaves the control room desk. 
It is an old, wireless set that is the same size and weight of a masonry brick.
The ringer volume is set to blaring loud and can't be changed, which is great for 
day shift but annoying during the quiet of night shift.
